# Forest Plot

### Overview
This repository provides an example of a forest plot inspired by Katherine Hoffman's work (reference). The plot visualizes the **Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR)** and their corresponding **95% Confidence Intervals (CI)** for three acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) risk groups:
1. **Neutral**
2. **Favorable**
3. **Unfavorable**

### Features
- **Visual Representation:** Clearly shows the IRR and CI for each risk group, allowing easy comparison.
- **Customizations:** Demonstrates how to fine-tune plot aesthetics, such as axis labels, annotations, and error bar styles.
- **Reproducible Code:** Includes script for plot generating using R.

### Repository Contents
- **`scripts/`**: R scripts for creating the forest plot, including data preparation and visualization.
- **`data/`**: Example dataset used for plotting.
- **`outputs/`**: Example plot outputs for reference.

### How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd forest-plot
